Xeremiow: Your Feline AI Agent Framework
Xeremiow is an innovative, open-source Python framework designed to let you deploy your own cat-themed AI agents on various platforms, powered by state-of-the-art AI models like those from OpenAI or Anthropic.

CatPy is developed from a specialized version of the Zerebro backend, now tailored for feline enthusiasts. With CatPy, you can create your own AI cat with functionalities similar to a sentient pet but with the intelligence and capabilities of modern AI.
